# Advanced-Course-in-Programming-minigame
Completed the course in the University of Helsinki

I created a minigame as a final project of the course.

The object of the game is to collect coins and dodge monsters. If a player hits a coin, the score goes up.

If a player hits a monster, the score is reset.

The primary objective of the game is to collect 20 coins without hitting the monsters. In this case, the player passes the game and there is a winning declaration on the screen!

Whenever you collect a sufficient number of coins, the background color of the game changes.

The challenge comes at a point when the player reaches 15 points. In this case, the background color becomes fused to the monsters.
